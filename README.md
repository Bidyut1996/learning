### Start of learning Markdown language###

**Markdown** is a *markup* language that offers a lean approach to content editing by _shielding content creators from the overhead of HTML_. While HTML is great for rendering content exactly how it was intended, it takes up a lot of space and can be unwieldy to work with, even in small doses. __Markdown__ offers a great compromise between the power of HTML for content description and the ease of plain text for editing.
